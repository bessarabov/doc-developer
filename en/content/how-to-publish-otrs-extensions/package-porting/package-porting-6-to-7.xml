    <section id="no-sessions-without-cookies">
        <title>Sessions always require cookies</title>
        <para>
            Starting from OTRS 7, <ulink url="https://github.com/OTRS/otrs/commit/831aba1cfe6893d0633af6f18584216e89198072">
            sessions always require cookies to be enabled</ulink>. Therefore, the
            <literal>SessionIDCookie</literal> value was removed from <literal>LayoutObject</literal>,
            Templates and JavaScript. It is no longer necessary to append session variables to URLs or
            HTTP request payloads.

    <section id="groups-table-renamed">
        <title>The <literal>groups</literal> table was renamed</title>
        <para>
            Due to a change in MySQL 8, the table <literal>groups</literal> had to be renamed to
            <literal>groups_table</literal>. If you use this table directly in any SQL statements, they will
            need to be adapted. For more information, see
            <ulink url="https://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13866">bug#13866</ulink>.
