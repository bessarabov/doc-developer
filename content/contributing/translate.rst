Translating
===========

The translations are contributed and maintained mainly by OTRS users, so *your* help is needed.

All translations of the OTRS GUI, the public extension modules and the documentations are managed via
`Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/otrs/OTRS/>`__.

To contribute to translations:

1. Sign up for a free translator account on `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com>`__.
2. Join your `language team <https://www.transifex.com/otrs/teams/>`__ and wait for the acceptance.
3. Start updating your translation. No additional software or files required.

.. note::

   If your language is not listed in the dashboard, you can request a new language on *Transifex*. After it is approved, you can start translating.

From OTRS 7 the documentations are available in *reStructuredText* format, that replaced the old *DocBook* format. Be careful not to break the structure while translating the documentation.

.. seealso::

   You can find some examples in the :doc:`../documentation` chapter.

The OTRS developers will download the translations from time to time into the OTRS source code repositories, you don't have to submit them anywhere.
