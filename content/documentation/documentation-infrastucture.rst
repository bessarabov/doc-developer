Documentation Infrastructure
============================

OTRS uses `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ to generate the outputs. The HTML output is generated using the `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ theme.

.. note::

   All outputs are customized on the build server. If you want to setup a developer environment in your local machine for testing and writing the documentation, the outputs can be different.
